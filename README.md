This is a useless program that will never be used by anyone else because it has zero real world application 99.99% of the time

All it does is take an excel document in a very specific format and converts it into another very specific format

Literally (x, y) -> (y, x)

To use it simply select the file that Crab al vomited out and select the correct file type. Press run and if nothing breaks hit export and voila.
If anything breaks then only god knows what went wrong because i can't be bothered to write error messages.

Also it has to be opened from Visual Studio because i am not a developer and screw passing around installer.
